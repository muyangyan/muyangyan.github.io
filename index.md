I'm an incoming senior in CS at Purdue researching Neuro-symbolic AI in robotics. I'm advised by [Prof. Yexiang Xue](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/yexiang/) and [Prof. Zak Kingston](https://zkingston.com/) at Purdue CS, and [Prof. Katia Sycara](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sycara/) at CMU's Robotics Institute.

I want to build systems that can continually acquire and reason about both explicit and implicit knowledge to learn about and act in the real world. Explicit knowledge (facts, properties, relationships, and rules) is easily composable and well-suited for symbolic manipulation and reasoning, while implicit knowledge (scene understanding, physical intuition, control) is necessary to interface with the unstructured world. I want to develop frameworks and algorithms that combine robot learning, computer vision, and symbolic planning to enable more general robots.

Outside of research, I love rock climbing, music production, and table tennis.
