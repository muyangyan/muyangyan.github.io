I'm a senior in CS at Purdue researching Neuro-symbolic AI for robotics. I'm advised by [Prof. Yexiang Xue](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/yexiang/) and [Prof. Zak Kingston](https://zkingston.com/) at Purdue CS, and [Prof. Katia Sycara](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sycara/) at CMU's Robotics Institute.

I want to build systems that can continually acquire and reason about both explicit and implicit knowledge to learn about and act in the real world alongside humans. To this end, I study the use of neuro-symbolic abstractions to enable efficient planning, robust generalization, data-efficient learning, and verifiable behavior in robotic planning. In particular, I aim to develop abstractions that are aware of uncertainty in the real world, including that which arises from humans.

Outside of research, I love rock climbing, table-tennis, and music production.
