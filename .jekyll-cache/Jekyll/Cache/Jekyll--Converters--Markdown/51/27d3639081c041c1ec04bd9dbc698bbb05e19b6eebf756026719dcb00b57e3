I"X<p>I’m an incoming senior in CS at Purdue researching Neuro-symbolic AI for robotics. I’m advised by <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/yexiang/">Prof. Yexiang Xue</a> and <a href="https://zkingston.com/">Prof. Zak Kingston</a> at Purdue CS, and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sycara/">Prof. Katia Sycara</a> at CMU’s Robotics Institute.</p>

<p>I want to build systems that can continually acquire and reason about both explicit and implicit knowledge to learn about and act in the real world.</p>

<p>Outside of research, I love rock climbing, music production, and table tennis.</p>
